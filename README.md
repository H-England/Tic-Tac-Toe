# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is Tic-Tac-Toe.

To play, select a game mode of either a single match or first to 3. Then play as you usually would.

If you are finding it too difficult, go into the src folder, then into components, and finally into the algorithm folder where you find a variable called difficulty. 100 is the max difficulty and 1 is the lowest, so find the right fit for you.
